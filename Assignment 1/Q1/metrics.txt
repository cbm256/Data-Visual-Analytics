-Average node degree = 1.554
Shows the average number of edges per node. 
-Diameter of the graph = 9
Shows the longest of all the calculated shortest (geodesic) paths in a network. It represents the linear size of a network. Some directed graphs have non-reachable node pairs, in which case the diameter is undefined. 
-Average path length = 2.797
Shows the number of steps to get from one node to another node in a network. This is calculated by adding the shortest paths between all pair of nodes and dividing by total number of pairs.
