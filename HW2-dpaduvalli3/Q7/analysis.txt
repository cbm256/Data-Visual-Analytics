1.Excel is a visualization tool that I am familiar with.  

2.Excel is very easy to use since there are already built in graphs readily available. It is similar to Tableau as both requires minimal coding when compared to D3.

3.Storing multiple excel files consumes memory. Tableau is useful since visualization can be stored on cloud.

4.Excel spreadsheets is widely used in organizations. End users can easily access and manipulate files. Tableau and D3 require special permissions. 

5.Excel files cannot be scaled due to lack of storage capability. Its better to stick to d3.

6.Excel needs to be installed with Office 365 license. Online version of excel has very limited features. Collaboration of excel projects is very difficult since Microsoft does not have a good collaboration file sharing platform like google drive. Tableau might come handy since a project can be shared with multiple users.
